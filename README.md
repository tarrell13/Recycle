# Recycle

This program sends items to the recycle/trash bin on Mac OSX and Debian Systems.
I am currenly still tweaking the "install.sh" script to properly install all necessary
components on systems that use "YUM" as their package manager. The script will work on those systems
but the install won't be automated.

Program Requirements
1. python3
2. Send2trash module for python3

UPDATE BRANCH

Currently working on expanding the programs functionality to include:
    a. Nuke Command: To delete files from bin
    b. Show Command: To display Contents

Work in Progress....
